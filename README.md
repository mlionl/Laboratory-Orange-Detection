# Orange-Detection

Inspired by some works and articles, I took pictures of citrus trees in the Seville countryside during the harvest season. Establishing a first approximation to an estimation system for oranges is the main objective of this repository. Estimating the number of fruits is a really complex task that is carried out by very experienced farmers. It is a crucial task so a more efficient estimation method could be beneficial for the farmer.

Images were took by a drone, some exaples bellow:
