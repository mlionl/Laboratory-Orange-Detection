# Orange-Detection

## *Description*

Inspired by some works and articles, I took pictures of citrus trees in a countryside near Seville during the harvest season. Establishing a first approach to an estimation system for localization and counting oranges is the main objective of this repository. Estimating the number of fruits is a really complex task that is carried out by very experienced farmers. It is a crucial task so a more efficient estimation method could be beneficial for the farmer. 

## *Data*

Images were taken by a drone, because time limitations I only labeled 13 images using Labelme Tool. I labeled fruits of the tree one by one using rectangular mode.

*Some examples of the data:*
